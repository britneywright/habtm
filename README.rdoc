This is an example I put together of how to create a has_and_belongs_to_many relationship in Rails 4. The example is based on a relationship of kids that get many different candies for Halloween and candies that go to many different kids on Halloween. You can see it in action, along with step-by-step instructions, at http://habtmexample.herokuapp.com/.
